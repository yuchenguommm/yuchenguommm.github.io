Inspired by recent experimental findings, we investigate various scenarios of the doped Hubbard model with impurity potentials. We calculate the lattice Greenâ€™s function in a finite-size cluster and then map it to the continuum real space, which allows for a direct comparison with scanning tunneling microscopy measurements on the local density of states. Our simulations successfully reproduce experimental data, including the characteristic stripe- and ladder-shaped structures observed in cuprate systems. Moreover, our results establish a connection between previous numerical findings on stripe-ordered ground states and experimental observations, thus providing new insights into microscopic mechanisms of the Mott insulator to superconductor transition in cuprates.
