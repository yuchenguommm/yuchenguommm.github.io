I'm a second-year Ph.D. student from [Department of Physics](https://www.phys.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/), interested in the interplay between quantum computation, quantum information, and topological quantum matter.

I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Shuo Yang (she/her/hers), a rising star in the field of condensed matter physics and quantum physics ([her home page](https://sites.google.com/view/shuoyang1984)).

Currently, I am focusing on solving problems in quantum computation, quantum information, and topological quantum matter with the tool of the tensor network (TN) family.
* Developing new quantum computation techniques
* Discovering novel topological quantum matter
* Exploring the interplay between noise and entanglement

I have published several research articles in top journals including Physical Review X (PRX), Physical Review Letters (PRL), PRX Quantum, npj Quantum Information, etc. I am also a referee for PRX, PRL, PRX Quantum, PRR, PRA, and PRB. You can find my CV here: [Yuchen Guo's Curriculum Vitae](cv/).
