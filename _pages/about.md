I'm a first-year Ph.D. student from [Department of Physics](https://www.phys.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/), interested in the interplay between quantum computation, quantum information, and topological quantum matter.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Shuo Yang](https://www.phys.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1101/4258.htm) (she/her/hers), a rising star in the field of condensed matter physics and quantum physics ([Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nemjDVIAAAAJ&hl)).

Currently, I am focusing on solving problems in quantum computation, quantum information, and topological quantum matter with the tool of the tensor network (TN) family.
* Developing new quantum computation techniques
* Discovering novel topological quantum matter
* Exploring the interplay between noise and entanglement

I have published several research articles in top journals including Physical Review Letters (PRL), PRX Quantum, npj Quantum Information, etc. I am also a referee for PRL, PRX Quantum, PRR, PRA, and PRB. You can find my CV here: [Yuchen Guo's Curriculum Vitae](cv/).
