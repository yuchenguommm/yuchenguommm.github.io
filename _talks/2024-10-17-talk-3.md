In this talk, I plan to introduce our two recent works (arXiv 2403.16978 and arXiv 2408.03239) on topological phases in open quantum systems. I will begin with reviewing the classification of quantum phases in closed systems and properties of corresponding phase transitions. Next, I will discuss our tensor network construction for a specific class of topological states, namely average symmetry protected topological (ASPT) phases, defined in open systems, especially with a nontrivial extension of strong and weak symmetry. I will then introduce a new framework to systematically study the phase transitions between different open system quantum phases with the imaginary-time Lindbladian evolution. To illustrate the effectiveness of this framework, we apply it to investigate the phase diagram for open systems with Z_2^σ×Z_2^τ symmetry, including cases with nontrivial ASPT order or spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) order. I will finally discuss several universal properties at quantum criticality, such as nonanalytic behaviors of steady-state observables, divergence of correlation lengths, and closing of the imaginary-Liouville gap. These results advance our understanding of quantum phase transitions in open quantum systems.
